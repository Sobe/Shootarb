  -- The End
- Externalize ctrls in a dedicated class like "PlayerCtrl"
- Externalize management of UI (text dsiplay methods)
- Replace player's crash uggly picture by an animation or something (reconstructing particles ?)
- Wave Generator
  -- Refactor it
  -- DSL for this?
- Make a command pattern (?) to insert "actions" (e.g: shooting) in ennemies with traj behavior (i.e update() method)
- Crash particles:
  -- Less
  -- Different colors according to the type of ennemy
  -- Limit life of a particle in time
- Scrolling background
  -- OpenGL or not needed?
  -- Background elements
- BUG Score not added when add_weapon() on player (bad access to @score ?)
- Make PAUSE possible (no update if paused => will make bugs with local timers)
