*  ================  *

A little vertical shoot'em up coded in Ruby with Gosu.
It's currently on its earliest stage of development, so don't expect an awesome user's experience.

No license yet, but it'll probably be GNU or BSD... something free.

Do not hesitate to contact me (see "Links") for questions or whatever about this game.

----------------
  Requirements
----------------

Shootarb intends to be as portable as possible, i.e. where Ruby and Gosu run.
It's currently developped under MS Windows XP, but will soon be tested under Linux...
You just need:
- Ruby 1.8.6 (or later... but not tested with 1.9)
- Gosu library for Ruby v 0.7.15

------------
  Controls
------------

- 'Arrow keys' to move
- 'Z' to shoot ('W' on AZERTY keyboards)
- 'P' for pause (buggy now...)
- 'ESC' to exit
